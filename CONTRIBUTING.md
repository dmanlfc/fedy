### Writing plugins

Plugins can be placed under `~/.local/share/fedy/plugins/`, or in the system
plugins directory.

Each plugin is a directory with the suffix `.plugin`, which consist of a JSON
formatted metadata file. The metadata file contains information about the
plugin and describes how `Fedy` should run the tasks.

The plugins can run any command or scripts (`bash`, `python` etc.). In addtion
to the system commands, `Fedy` provides an additional command, `run-as-root` to
allow running commands (e.g.- `run-as-root touch /some/file/somewhere`) or
scripts (e.g.- `run-as-root -s do-stuff.sh`) as root.

Have a look at the existing plugins to know more about how to write plugins for
`Fedy`.
